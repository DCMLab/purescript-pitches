A library for dealing with musical intervals and pitches.
Currently supports spelled intervals/pitches as used in Western notation and theory.
Support for other types might be added later, if needed.

The interface is very similar to the
[Haskell version of the library](https://github.com/DCMLab/haskell-musicology/tree/master/musicology-pitch),
using functional dependencies instead of associate types in some cases.
Also check out the following other implementations:
- [pitches.rs (Rust)](https://github.com/DCMLab/rust-pitches/)
- [Pitches.jl (Julia)](https://github.com/DCMLab/Pitches.jl/)
- [pitchtypes (Python)](https://github.com/DCMLab/pitchtypes)
